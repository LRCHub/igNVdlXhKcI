Let's Marvin Gaye and get it on
You got that healing that I want
Just like they say it in the song
Until the dawn
Let's Marvin Gaye and get it on
We got this king-size to ourselves
Don't have to share with no one else
Don't keep your secrets to yourself
It's Kama Sutra show and tell
Whoooa, there's lovin' in your eyes
That pulls me closer
(Oh it pulls me closer)
It's so subtle, I'm in trouble
But I'd love to be in trouble with you
Let's Marvin Gaye and get it on
You got that healing that I want
Just like they say it in the song
Until the dawn
Let's Marvin Gaye and get it on
You've got to give it up to me
I'm screaming 'Mercy, mercy, please!'
Just like they say it in the song
Until the dawn
Let's Marvin Gaye and get it on
And when you leave me all alone
I'm like a stray without a home
I'm like a dog without a bone
I just want you for my own
I got to have you babe
Whoooa, there's lovin' in your eyes
That pulls me closer
(Oh it pulls me closer)
It's so subtle, I'm in trouble
But I'd rather be in trouble with you
Let's Marvin Gaye and get it on
Oooh babe, I've got that healing that
you want, yeah
(Meghan)
Like they say it in the song
Until the dawn
Let's Marvin Gaye and get it on
Let's Marvin Gaye and get it on
You got that healing that I want
Just like they say it in the song
Until the dawn
Let's Marvin Gaye and get it on
You've got to give it up to me
I'm screaming 'Mercy, mercy, please!'
Just like they say it in the song
Until the dawn
Let's Marvin Gaye and get it on
Just like they say it in the song
Until the dawn
Let's Marvin Gaye and get it on
Oooh
