[00:36.76] Whoa-oh-oh-oh, there's lovin' in your eyes that pulls me closer
[00:43.59] (Oh, it pulls me closer)

[01:45.47] 
[01:27.95] And when you leave me all alone
[01:32.12] I'm like a stray without a home
[01:36.40] I'm like a dog without a bone
[01:40.65] I just want you for my own
[01:44.51] I got to have you, babe
[01:56.01] 
[01:46.67] Whoa-oh-oh-oh, there's lovin' in your eyes that pulls me closer

[01:55.46] It's so subtle (it's so subtle), I'm in trouble (I'm in trouble)
[01:59.08] But I'd rather be in trouble with you
[02:17.58] 
[02:03.39] Let's Marvin Gaye and get it on
[02:07.77] Ooh, baby, I got that healing that you want, yeah

[02:46.25] Just like they say it in the song
[02:49.55] Until the dawn, let's Marvin Gaye and get it on
[03:13.05] 
[02:55.48] Just like they say it in the song
